# Data visualization with R and ggplot2 - part 2

This week, we will continue working together to reformat data and create graphics using R's ggplot2 library. 

- [Data transformation](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-transform.html) from "R for Data Science"
- [ggplot protein abundance tutorial](geneplots.md)
- [Volcano plots](https://biocorecrg.github.io/CRG_RIntroduction/volcano-plots.html) tutorial

All of these are best experienced by working through them yourself!  Take some time and try them out on your own datasets
