# Data visualization with R and ggplot2 - part 2

Homework:

Take some of your data that you have lying around. Read it in, get it into a tidy format, and then make an informative plot, complete with labels, theming, etc.  For-credit students, send a nice-looking plot and the code you used to create it to John.

If you don't have a data set, feel free to use one of the example sets from this week's lecture.
