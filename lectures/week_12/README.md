# Week 12

## RNAseq Part 3

- [Lecture Recording](coming soon!)

- [Differential Expression Slides](https://github.com/genome/bfx-workshop/blob/master/lectures/week_12/bfx-RNASeq-Module3-DifferentialExpression.pdf)

- [RNA-seq Bioinformatics](https://rnabio.org/course)

## RNAseq Course Setup

For the BFX Workshop, we will not be using AWS Cloud. Instead, we will use a Docker image created from the AWS AMI used in rnabio.org.

### Docker Setup

Instructions for setting up docker can be found [here](https://github.com/genome/bfx-workshop/tree/master/lectures/week_10)

### User Setup

**Reminder:** Now that we are running a Docker container, Docker, by default, will log you in as the "root" user. We need to run as the ubuntu user to match the RNAseq course tutorials.

1. Switch User `su` to the unbutu user:

```bash
su ubuntu
```

2. Source the pre-installed `.bashrc` file to configure your environment to match the RNAseq course:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
3. Set the environment variable
```bash
export RNA_HOME=~/workspace/rnaseq
``` 

NOTE: Using Docker and the persistent "workspace" volume we attached will allow you to start/stop as you wish. EVERYTIME YOU LOGIN TO THE DOCKER CONTAINER, YOU MUST LOGIN AS THE `ubuntu` USER *AND* `source ~/.bashrc` UPON EACH LOGIN.
