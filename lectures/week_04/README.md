## Week 4: DNA Alignment Fundamentals

This week, we cover some basics of how sequence is generated, delve into the details of data and formats, and talk through basic QC of your sequence.

## Homework Assignment

Let's play around with some real sequence data and align it, working in a jupyter notebook. (Note that jupyter is only one way to run these commands. The same steps would work directly from a unix terminal prompt). Ask for help in the #bfx_workshop slack channel if you get stuck!
