- The assignment involves using RStudio to analyze metagenomics data.  Instructions are provided for running things [locally, on your laptop](instruction_local_docker_Rstudio.md), or using the [RIS cluster](instruction_RIS_docker_Rstudio.md). 

## Exercisee
Walk through each of the 3 Rmd scripts. Be sure to edit the paths at the beginning of each script as appropriate for your environment! For the first script, send in a screenshot of the error frequency vs quality score graphs. For the second script, what proportion of reads are retained? Look carefully in the console output- it's easy to miss; look for a comment that says "ensuring retained majority of reads". For the third script, send in the abundance comparison venn diagram.
