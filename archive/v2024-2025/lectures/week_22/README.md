## Exercise
This week's exercise has 4 parts, each of which builds on the last. You will use R to train a machine learning model, then generate some plots to visualize the data and the performance of the model. Make sure to read the instructions and provided code carefully- some paths will need to be changed, some libraries do not need to be installed or loaded more than once, and the code for generating some of the required data is in a github link in the writeup of the first part.
