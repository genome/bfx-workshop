# Data visualization with R and ggplot2 - part 2

This week, we will continue working together to create graphics using R's ggplot2 library. 

- Follow along with the [R visualization - ggplot2](https://pmbio.org/module-10-appendix/0010/07/01/ggplot2/) page.
- We'll also work through the [ggplot protein abundance tutorial](geneplots.md)

Homework:

1) Work through this tutorial on [manipulating data with dplyr](https://gist.github.com/chrisamiller/d673ab33b1bb7e11d6234ba14c1dfe93#manipulating-data-with-dplyr). It was optional way back in week 6, but it'll be very useful now that we're talking about ggplot. 

2) Follow the instructions at the end and use ggplot to make a beautiful figure demonstrating an interesting relationship in these fictional starwars species (height/mass/sex might be good places to start). Remember axis labels, legends, themes, and other things that we talked about!  For-credit students, please send your figure to John Garza.
