## Week 6: Data manipulation and basic plotting with R

- [Lecture Recording](https://wustl.box.com/s/uqtw3i63h23ga6fcyzghdasnvdq7v06h)
- [Slides](intro_to_R.pdf)

## Homework Assignment

1) If you weren't able to follow along with the R commands we used during the lecture, go back through the slides and run the commands yourself.

2) Work though [Data munging and cleaning with R](https://gist.github.com/chrisamiller/d673ab33b1bb7e11d6234ba14c1dfe93). If you're brand new to R, this my be challenging! Refer back to our lessons in the lecture often, and use your options for help. Note that the last section (dplyr) is optional. 

3) Finally, using R and some of the commands from this week's lecture and slides, try reading in a data file that you have lying around and making some sort of simple plot from it. If you don't have anything, ask in slack and we can make some suggestions for public data. 

For-credit students: please send Jenny the temperature boxplot you create from the cleaned-up data (in #2) as proof of completion.
