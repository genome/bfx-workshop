- [Slides](intro_to_R.pdf)

## Homework Assignment

1) Work though [Manipulating files at the command line](bash_intro.md)
2) If you weren't able to follow along with the R commands we used during the lecture, go back through the slides and run them yourself.  
3) Finally, using R and some of the commands from this week's lecture and slides, try reading in a data file that you have lying around and making some sort of simple plot from it.
