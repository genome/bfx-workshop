# Data visualization

This week's lecture and exercise is in two parts: 

1) A lecture that encourages thinking big-picture about how to represent your data. [Lecture slides](r_dataviz.pdf)

2) For those of you who missed the ggplot2 tutorial last semester, we're going to revisit that, and talk about the fundamentals of creating plots using the ggplot2 package in R. Follow along with the [R visualization - ggplot2](https://pmbio.org/module-10-appendix/0010/07/01/ggplot2/) page.

This week's assignment is:

1) Finish going through any steps of the ggplot2 tutorial we didn't get to

2) Generate an informative and pretty-looking plot using any dataset that we used in today's tutorial. Use colors, labels, legend, etc, to make your plot something that's ready to published. Save it as a pdf of appropriate size for a journal (probably no bigger than 4x4 in) and make sure it's legible and interpretable even when displayed at that size.  

For credit students, Send your plot in an email to Jenny as proof of completion.
