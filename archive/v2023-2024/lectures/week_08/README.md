This week's lecture and exercise talks about some fundamentals of data visualization, then dives into creating graphics with the ggplot2 package in R. Follow along with the [R visualization - ggplot2](https://pmbio.org/module-10-appendix/0010/07/01/ggplot2/) page.

This week's assignment is:
1) Finish going through any steps of the tutorial we didn't get to
2) Load the `starwars` data (instead of the `mpg` data we used this week) and make a pretty graph that tells you something informative.  Use colors, move the axes, scale them appropriately, add titles and legends, etc.
